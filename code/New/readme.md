run npm run dev and node api_server.js both in backend and npm run dev in frontend
if npm run dev doesn't work properly in backend, do node new_server.js

working: getts info makes all necessary files. generates timetable(fles are created in backend), add course, timetable display thing, timetable drag drop, save timetable(saved in backend)

not working: no generate stats for edited timetable, doesn't display stats for selected stats
            view timetables page..(timetables saved in /data/timetables.json, just fetching and display issues, wrote functions..not working)

To Do :- 1. Clashes after edit 2. Download TImetable pdf, csv 2. After edit generate new stats 3. View stats on website, 4. View timetables page
